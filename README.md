# Eskom Generation Capacity Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the monthly Eskom generation capacity breakdown using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on understanding the available capacity, unavailability components (PCLF, UCLF, OCLF), and their impact on Eskom's power generation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the `data` directory. It includes monthly data on Eskom's generation capacity and unavailability components. The dataset is named `MEGCB.csv`.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook, which can be found in the `analysis` directory. The notebook includes the following key sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded and prepared for analysis. Data cleaning and transformation are performed as needed.

2. **Monthly Ratio Calculation**: Monthly ratios are calculated to determine the percentage of available capacity relative to total capacity. These ratios are used to assess the capacity utilization.

3. **Visualization**: The analysis includes visualizations of the monthly capacity breakdown, highlighting the available capacity and contributions of unavailability factors (PCLF, UCLF, OCLF).

4. **Conclusion**: The analysis is summarized, highlighting key insights, trends, and recommendations based on the data.

## Running the Analysis

To run this analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

3. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `analysis` directory and execute each cell in order.
